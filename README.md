# Hexadoku
A command-line Hexedoku solver written in Haskell and for high performance

Hexadoku is like Sudoku, but with 16x16 instead of 9x9. The digits 0 through 9 are used
along with the letters A to F.

This is very similar to my Sudoku solver, and much of the code is the same, and someday
I may merge the two...

For usage information, run 'hexadoku -h'.
